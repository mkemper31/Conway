# Conway
Basic JS implementation of Conway's Game of Life

This is a very basic implementation of the classic Game of Life by John Conway. In its current iteration, it uses the console for output.

The dimensions of the grid are arbitrary and configurable, as are the number of rounds that the game runs. Each run initializes with a new, randomized grid. "Alive" cells are indicated with `1`, and "dead" cells are indicated with `0`.
